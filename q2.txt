#2: The initial problem with the provided small CNN was that its single convolutional layer wasn't capturing the relationships between the features of the data enough and the learning rate was too large, which led to the model not converging. To fix this, I added two more convolutional layers with extra filters to learn the data more wholly and I decreased the learning rate to help the model converge. This led to overfitting though, because of the increased complexity of the model, so I fixed this issue by changing the optimizer and adding regularization to the training. The optimizer change was mostly due to the fact that I've had previous success with the Adamax optimizer over other ones, but the regularization directly addressed the overfitting, and the final model was able to achieve an test accuracy of 70% on CIFAR10.
